# rosbag2json
A converter that takes ROS bag files and turns them into JSON files. This code was inspired by/derived from Nick Speal's **bag2csv** project, in his [ROStools](https://github.com/nickspeal/ROStools) repository.

Note: JSON files are text, and they're big! Giant bags will become giant-er JSONs, as far as file size is concerned.
